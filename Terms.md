### Autodesk Developer Network (ADN)

I am a member of Autodesk Developer Network.

If it is not stated that materials are free to use please contact me before using them and ask for permission. Mentioning me in your posts / web pages or other articles doesn't cost you much and most of the time it will be everything I will ask for.

### Use of my tools

Applies to all (among others) plugins, C# or Python scripts, Dynamo graphs or any other created by me software.  

All Revit API add-ons are experimental in nature. Those applications are provided "as is" with no warranty of any kind and you use the applications at your own risk. 

That said all the tools were thoroughly tested. If you see any problems please [contact Us](mailto:apps@w7k.pl) and we will try to help as soon as possible! 

Keep in mind that Autodesk Revit provides you an option to undo any changes you made. In short please have some basic Revit knowledge, know what you try to do and you will be fine.

### Use of experimental revit tools

My add-ons sometimes contain experimental scripts. They are working fine and for now they are part of the provided toolset. 

The thing is, that in the future they might become a part of new add-on, move to other already existing add-on or simply be converted into standard tools in their current toolbar. Some of them might end up in the bin!   

I don't know what will happen with them but I want to share them with you as soon as possible.
