I'm always trying to add an information about an intellectual property (who was the author or where I got the knowledge from). I expect the same from others.  

If it is not stated that materials are free to use please contact me before using them and ask for permission. Mentioning me in your posts / web pages or other articles doesn't cost you anything and most of the time it will be everything I will ask for.

### Use of the revit tools

All Revit API add-ons are experimental in nature. Those applications are provided "as is" with no warranty of any kind and you use the applications at your own risk. 

That said all the tools were thoroughly tested. If you see any problems please [contact Us](mailto:apps@w7k.pl) and we will try to help as soon as possible! 

Keep in mind that Autodesk Revit provides you an option to undo any changes you made. In short please have some basic Revit knowledge, know what you try to do and you will be fine.
