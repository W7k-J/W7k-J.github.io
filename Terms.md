Please be aware that all works (including my plugins, scripts, code and tools etc.) are protected by copyright. Unauthorized use, reproduction, distribution, or modification of these plugins is prohibited without explicit permission. If you wish to use or incorporate any part of my plugins, kindly reach out to me for authorization.

### Use of my tools

Applies to all (among others) plugins, C# or Python scripts, Dynamo graphs or any other created by me software.  

All Revit API add-ins are experimental in nature. Those applications are provided "as is" with no warranty of any kind and you use the applications at your own risk. 

That said all the tools were thoroughly tested. If you see any problems please [contact Us](mailto:apps@w7k.pl) and we will try to help as soon as possible! 

Keep in mind that Autodesk Revit provides you an option to undo any changes you made. In short please have some basic Revit knowledge, know what you try to do and you will be fine.

### Use of experimental revit tools

My add-ins occasionally include experimental scripts. Currently, they are integrated into the provided plugin. However, in the future, they could become part of a new add-on, be incorporated into an existing one, or even evolve into standard tools within the current toolbar.  

Some may end up being discarded, but I’m eager to share them with you as soon as possible.
