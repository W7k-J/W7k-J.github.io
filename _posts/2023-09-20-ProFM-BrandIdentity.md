Creating a brand identity for ProFM, a facility management company

ProFM is a company that provides facility management services for offices, industrial and hospitality sectors. They have a wide range of interests and rich experience in their field, but they lacked a consistent brand identity. That’s where I came in.
We started working by creating a logo that reflects their values and vision. The final version resembles a "home". It conveys many connotations, just to name the few: warm , "feels like at home", sense of peace and security.    

For the main logo we decided to use gold, blue and white which symbolize excellence and expertise. We also added a subtle font to show the elegance and professionalism of ProFM’s services.
Next, we selected a colour palette that conveys their rich offer. We decided to use different colours for each sector.

Finally, we applied the brand identity elements to some mock-ups of ProFM’s profiles, business cards, brochures and uniforms. We made sure to keep a balance between consistency and creativity, using the same fonts, colours and symbols throughout, but also adding some variations and details to make each item unique and appealing.
The result is a brand identity that showcases ProFM’s expertise and versatility and helps them stand out from their competitors. I am very proud of this project! I hope it will help ProFM grow their business and reach new clients.
