I am very happy to invite you all to my first webinar, organized by Ignacy Lozinski from BIM Corner. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but at the same time, I hope to see you there!  
We will start by discussing how to create the perfect Revit template, but we won't stop there! Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with multiple architectural offices in Poland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Norway, and Australia. A good grasp of understanding "how things are set up here" has always been crucial for these jobs. It allowed me to quickly transition to new environments and contribute from day one.  
I won't lie – it also helps tremendously in making a very good first impression and sets you up as a Revit expert very quickly. Because of this, we will not only discuss how to create your own Revit template, but we will also delve deeper into the consequences of the choices others have made while setting up Revit projects. I don't want to just show you how to do something – we will talk about the pros and cons of every decision.  
During the discussion, we will also dive into view templates, filters, and learn how to change system families. In general, I plan to give you total control over what is visible on your drawings (and how it looks)!  
So, I highly recommend this webinar to everyone working with Revit! You don't need to be an expert to attend, as I will strive to make it as simple as possible. Still, we will have some advanced topics for experienced Revit users too!  
Also, don't hesitate to write in the comments if something gives you a big headache! I will try to include these topics too!
