During this year Iâ€™ve involved myself in a number of projects and have collaborated with different teams. Slowly a lot of projects are coming to the end and I will soon have a chance to post more about them.

Meanwhile, little success pop out with people from Studio4Space. I love working with them and it is always a pleasure and great learning experience.

In short we received 3rd price in a design competition for Juliusz Kossak square in Cracow.
