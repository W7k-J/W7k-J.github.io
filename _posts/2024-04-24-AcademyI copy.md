Leveler ended up on the list of the most popular paid apps for Revit on Autodesk App Store! It is an ultimate tool to work with levels and grids, helping you to work more efficiently!

It is my second app which got so popular to get this mark of recognition (Drafter got this title three months ago!). 

As you can see on the picture, it is much easier to convince people to buy my tools than to convince them to write a review about it (or even give it a star üòâ). Because of that, and to celebrate this milestone, I decided that everyone who already bought or will buy my main app Drafter during the next 10 days and will post an honest review about it on the Autodesk App Store will receive Leveler for free for the next year! 

Also, please, don‚Äôt hesitate to tell me what you don‚Äôt like about it! I am making my apps for you, so you don‚Äôt have to!

P.S. If you already have Leveler feel free to write a review about it ‚Äì I will get you ‚ÄúDrafter‚Äù too!
