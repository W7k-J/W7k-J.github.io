Drafter ended up on the list of the most popular paid apps for Revit on Autodesk App Store! 

I am proud to say that my pet project hit a new milestone. When I started this journey, my primary goal was to learn C# and streamline some of the most repetitive tasks that often plague professionals working in the AEC industry. 

My life’s problem is that I can’t simply “suck it up and do my job”. Everyone who worked with me knows that I'm always looking for solutions to work more efficiently, explore more suited programs, enhance workflows, or simply learn some shortcuts. Learning programming (C# and the Revit API) was just the next logical step in my journey.

As a result, I’ve already published 2 apps (with a third on the way) containing around 250 different scripts. These scripts are crafted to address common problems and pains in your (and my) daily work - whether it’s tweaking drawings, aligning tags, or adjusting levels. Now count to 250+ 

The best thing is that you don’t need to learn programming to be able to use my apps! You just need to give it a try! One month of trial is included, so there is really no reason not to do it!
