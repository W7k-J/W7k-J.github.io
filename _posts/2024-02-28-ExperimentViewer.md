<!--excerpt-->

I am continuing my series of experiments with Revit API. Today I would like to show you something Iâ€™ve been working on for quite some time. The purpose of this tool is to completely automate the process of creating internal elevations. I spent a lot of my time working on fit-out projects and this is something which I always wanted to automate completely. 

The tool is almost ready, I just need to polish it a little bit and add some memory tools. Because of that, it is also a perfect time to implement some other features I might have missed! 
Please tell me what you think! Should I add some other options to it?
