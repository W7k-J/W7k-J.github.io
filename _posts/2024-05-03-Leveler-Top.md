Leveler ended up on the list of the most popular paid apps for Revit on Autodesk App Store! It is an ultimate tool for levels and grids, helping you to work more efficiently! 

It is my second app, which got so popular to get this mark of recognition (Previously, Drafter got this title around three months ago!).

I was recently asked why (and how) I decided to build my tools. All of them were created simply because I saw a clear need for them. I've seen my colleagues and friends wasting time, doing countless stupid things which should be automated. As I mentioned before, "While everyone is hyped up about AI and BIM, people who do the projects are adding lengths with a calculator!". And for me, such a waste of creative potential is a crime! 

Meanwhile, as you can see on the picture, it is much easier for me to convince people to buy my tools than to ask them to write a review about them (or even give them a star üòâ). Because of that, and to celebrate this milestone, I decided that everyone who already bought or will buy my main app, Drafter, during the next 10 days and will post an honest review about it on the Autodesk App Store will receive Leveler for free for the next year! 

Also, please, don‚Äôt hesitate to tell me what you don‚Äôt like about my tools!

P.S. If you already have Leveler feel free to write a review about it ‚Äì I will get you ‚ÄúDrafter‚Äù too!
