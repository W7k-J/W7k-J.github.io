<!--excerpt-->

I recently started playing with changing families via Revit API. Please find some of my first examples of what is possible with it – for example, I can change multiple families at the same time and create them from external text files (JSON in my case).

Revit API Classes like FamilySymbol, FamilyInstance and Family allow us to fully control this part of Revit with a proper code. There are a lot of possibilities in this area just to name a few – different LOD families you can swap easily, automations in placing them inside the rooms, etc.

As such, I am curious about your opinions. What else would you like to automate with families?
