Recently, I had a chance to take part in Autodesk DevCon in Amsterdam. below some random notes I made during this event in chronological order:  

Day Zero:  
Dynamo Hackathon ‚Äì Together with Ammar Naqvi, Masoud Najjarian, H√•vard H√∏iby, Tarik Alboustani and Osman Sahinbozkir, we explored the idea of 10 minutes cities inside Autodesk Forma. We brought a lot of new data (points of interest) and we connected Forma to external sources via APIs to get even more info about the site. We calculated the distances to important points (using VASA and Kean Walmsley's knowledge). Meanwhile, I was visualizing the distance by foot between a selected point and the rest of the map (with a code I tinkered during this event).  
A lot of cool ideas for one group! Thanks to all the organizers for this event, Achintya Bhat!

Day One:  
Granularity, accessibility and interoperability ‚Äì In short, Autodesk will continue to open more APIs, give us more control over data and will allow further integration with external software. As a Revit pro user and developer at the same time, I really want to see more of it! Still, seeing my bold head on one of the slides from the main presentation made my day. It is official - Autodesk listens to me :)

More AI‚Ä¶ Somehow standard these days, but the idea of AI agents checking the progress and organizing meeting between people based on the progress in the models sounds interesting, especially to the introvert part of meüòâ  
 
During a break, I managed to talk shortly with Jeremy Tammik and say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù for all his help. He is one of the most important people in my programming journey‚Ä¶ From answering my early programming questions on Revit API forum to featuring some of my works on his blog, thank you for all of it!  

Interesting presentation by Puria Safari Hesari from Rambol about Data Exchange for Tekla and Revit. Cool to see software talking to each other. Another proof we don't need AI to make our life better.  

Luiz Henrique Cassettari, You are one of the few people sharing more complex workflows for Revit API! Thanks for that!  

Diner:

I somehow made it without AI Agent organizing my meetings and ordering my beerüòâ And I managed to meet some cool people in the process.  

Day Two:

Microsoft Fabric with Pawe≈Ç Krysztofi≈Ñski ‚Äì Super cool presentation with a live demo. Interesting and "in-use" workflow and new (to me) technology.

Sustainability Analysis (‚Ä¶) with Autodesk Forma with Aniruddha Phatak. My favourite presentation from this DevCon showcasing the development of new ways of analysing design in Forma. More reasons to get good in JS and Autodesk Forma üòâ  

Feedback session about AI with Revit and Dynamo teams - whoop‚Ä¶ that was a very productive session. Firstly, we made a list of things we want AI to do, later as a group, we decided that we don‚Äôt trust it to do it... In the end, we agreed that we want it to help us, but we need to keep strict control over it. So, AI stay away from my models for now!  

See you all next year!
