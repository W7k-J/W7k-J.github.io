I had the opportunity to be a speaker at the recent BIM Meetup in Cracow! It was an amazing experience to showcase my tools and share insights on why I am automating work in Autodesk Revit.
The BIM Meetup is a national conference (in Poland) that brings together professionals and enthusiasts in the field of Building Information Modelling (BIM). It's a platform for sharing knowledge, discussing innovative technologies, and networking with industry experts. The event features presentations, discussions, and workshops led by experienced practitioners share their insights on implementing modern technologies in the construction industry. Just to name a few this time I had a chance to speak next to people working on CPK, member of famous BIM Corner or Bim experts from AGH.  
  
During my presentation, I demonstrated how automation in Revit can significantly enhance productivity, reduce errors, and streamline workflows. By leveraging automation, we can focus more on creative and strategic aspects of our projects, rather than getting bogged down by repetitive tasks.

I shared many snippets of my code and tried to convince people to start their journey with coding. After some talks during after party I learned that a few people decided to finally do it!  
Thank you to everyone who attended and engaged in the discussion.
