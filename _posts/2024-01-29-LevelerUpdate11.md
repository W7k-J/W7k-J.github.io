<!--excerpt-->

My first add-in, Leveler, has got updated! The main task of this plugin is to control level assignments! To make it even more powerful, I added today 10 more scripts to it. They allow you to quickly rename the levels, grids and what is super cool - Change the height of multiple levels at the same time! Your groups already love it ;)
 
It is a part of my pledge to reinvest the money I get from sales of add-ins into further development of the tools I made! So, we can finally stop wasting time and concentrate on what we love! Without you learning how programming works!
 
For detail help, please visit: [Update info page](https://w7k.pl/tools/leveler11/)
 
You can get my add-in from Autodesk App Store at: [Page at Autodesk App Store](https://apps.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Detail/Index?id=7992073470185484796&appLang=en&os=Win64)
 
I am working on new tools for my largest toolset, Drafter and some other plugins! Sharing info about my tools and/or buying them helps a lot!

Also please do not hesitate to tell me what other tools and automations you would like to see as a part of Leveler!
