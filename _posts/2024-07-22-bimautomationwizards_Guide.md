Revit users often need to send lists of multiple sheets to others. This could be an email detailing which drawings are ready to be issued, a report listing sheet names, or a warning about drawings that will be deleted or superseded. Sadly, there is no way of doing it quickly!  

<div>
  <div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/axhAclXsYbg?si=5IyFbhCKVkMKrY4A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen
      style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe>
  </div>

To simplify this process, I developed a straightforward macro. It enables anyone on your team to select sheets in the project browser and easily copy-paste their names and numbers.  
Together with a group of cool people:  
  
Natalia Gawlik, Ignacy Łoziński and Piotr Spyra,  
  
We created a free guide to help you automate your work. The macro mentioned above is just a small part of it!
