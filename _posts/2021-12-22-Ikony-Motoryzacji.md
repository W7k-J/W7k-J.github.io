"Ikony motoryzacji", an exhibition of 50 unique cars, is right now open for visitors in Warsaw. If you are there it is your chance to see Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, Maserati, Bentley, Aston Martin and other rare brands of cars.

Without further ado, this is another interesting project I helped with recently. I was responsible for making layouts for this exhibition and analysing possible locations. It allowed us to find the best place to show all those beautiful machines.

Architecturally, it was a lot of fun trying to fit as many cars as possible without making the exhibition looking like a car park. Completely new perspective to what we, architects, normally do with cars ;)
