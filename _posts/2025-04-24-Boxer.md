Many people struggle with transitioning between 3D and 2D in Revit. People tend to work in 2d without really using a power of 3d modelling. As a result, we end up with a lot of clashes and mistakes, which were very easy to avoid. 
Recently, I spent some time investigating this issue, and with the help of the Revit API, I managed to create significant improvements to the default Revit workflows:  

1. New Selection and Conversion Method: Instead of selecting elements and using BX, you simply select two points, and the script adjusts the section box to the selected part of the view (with the depth of your currently active view).  

2. Quick Conversion of a section box to 2D Drawings: Just click on the face of the section box to convert it to a 2D section or plan.  

3. Instant 3D View of Plans, Sections, or Details: Click one button, and the script will assign a section box from your view to your default 3D view.  

4. Total Control Over Section Box: Align, rotate, mirror, set its precise size, or save it to memory for later use.  

Iâ€™m curious about your thoughts on this. Do you struggle with section boxes and transitioning between 2D and 3D, or is using "BX" sufficient for you?
