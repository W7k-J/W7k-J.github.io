I strongly believe in the power of nice drawings, neatly organized tags, consistency, I hate misalignments and "blinking" things in pdf-s. I learned that I could automate these (and other) things with Dynamo, but everyone should be able to do it without learning programming.

Drafter is intended to help you with all things connected with production of drawings so you can make them faster and be prouder of work you do!

For now, there are 180 scripts helping you to work faster and more precise. And this project will grow with time! I already have a list of almost 300 scripts I want to include in it.

All the tools are easy to use and master. Using only one of 180+ scripts will significantly improve your work! Also, I made this tool as cheap as possible, so everyone can afford it and save some time!
