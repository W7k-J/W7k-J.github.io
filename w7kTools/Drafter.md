I strongly believe in the power of nice drawings, neatly organized tags, consistency, I hate misalignments and "blinking" things in pdf-s. I learned that I could automate these (and other) things with Dynamo, but everyone should be able to do it without learning programming.

Drafter is intended to help you with all things connected with production of drawings so you can make them faster and be prouder of work you do!

For now, there are 180 scripts helping you to work faster and more precise. And this project will grow with time! I already have a list of almost 300 scripts I want to include in it.

All the tools are easy to use and master. Using only one of 180+ scripts will significantly improve your work! Also, I made this tool as cheap as possible, so everyone can afford it and save some time!

## Versions
[back to LIST](#list)  
Version 1 was published at XXXX-XX-XX. Works on Autodesk Revit 2020 - 2024. 

## Known Problems  
[back to LIST](#list)  

The number of tools makes it hard to make sure that all of them work 100% of times. So please don't try to break them and report problems to me! Together we can save even more time for you!

### Problems on To-Do List:

Tags and Text notes - alignment will not work as intended if you rotate the north - I already made it work on non-perpendicular sections and elevations, but still not on plans!
Tags and Text notes - copying leader settings from memory might not work on sections and elevations as intended.
Vertical Views - sadly for now they work only on elevations. I am on it. I never needed to use it on sections and  they are somehow diffrent (You can rotate them in 3d) it is way more complicate to edit them. I blocked them (you can still select them but I will skip them while adjusting the rest)

### Problems not on To-Do List:

Full support for older versions (2020, 2021, a few in 2022) – You are able to download the tool, but some buttons might not work (for example title lines, tags, legends1)
