## Versions
[back to LIST](#list)  
Version 1 was published at XXXX-XX-XX. Works on Autodesk Revit 2020 - 2024. 

## Known Problems  
[back to LIST](#list)  

The number of tools makes it hard to make sure that all of them work 100% of times. So please don't try to break them and report problems to me! Together we can save even more time for you!

### Problems on To-Do List:

Spatial Elements Tag (room tags, area tags etc) are not supported by Tag tools - WIP  
Tags and Text notes - alignment will not work as intended if you rotate the north - I already made it work on non-perpendicular sections and elevations, but still not on plans!  
Tags nudging - for 2020 - 2022 - Sorry no nudging for these versions ;) WIP
Tags and Text notes with multiple references - tag tools might not work for them as intended - WIP
Tags and Text notes - copying leader settings from memory might not work on sections and elevations as intended.  

### Problems not on To-Do List:

Full support for older versions (2020, 2021, a few in 2022) - You are able to download the tool, but some buttons might not work (for example title lines, tags, legends1)  

Your support will help improve this app!  

This toolset will grow in time! Your support will keep it alive and kicking! Please don't hesitate to contact me with a feedback or ideas of new features.
