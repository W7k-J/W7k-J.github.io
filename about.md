![Me](/images/JWLarge.png)  

My name is Julian Wandzilak. I will try to save my journey here (not only in AEC industry).  

So I am an architect, designer, BIM coordinator with a small but slowly growing knowledge of programming (Python, C++ and JS). Also I am a UAV pilot. And I do 3d models, 2d & 3d graphic design ;)

I am probably interested in too many things but "specialisation is for insects..."

Main areas:

[Architecture](https://w7k.pl/architecture/)  
[BIM](https://w7k.pl/bim/)
[Graphic Design](https://w7k.pl/gd/)  
[Programming](https://w7k.pl/programming/)    
[UAV](https://w7k.pl/uav/)  
[VR](https://w7k.pl/vr/)  
and many more  

Bear in mind that everything here is under construction and probably will be as long as I am alive ;)  
  
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need any help - especially with something cool!
